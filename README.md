# Game-Data-Project

Ive done an EDA on a game sales per region CSV including preparing and cleaning and analyzing the data provided as well as tested a few hypothesis related to the data. We decided what to do with missing values, formatted the column names, and made sure all data was in the correct data type. we then analyzed many different aspects of the data itself including comparisons standalone data and overall trends the data implies. We checked top performing platforms and genres and tested if the data fit certain hypothesis. We've created a better understanding of the data we were given and can use this to make further conclusions if needed.
